# Bulletin_of_opposition

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in digital
humanities. This interest is justified by the development of natural
language processing tools and the emergence of digitized text collections
of documents in different fields of knowledge, for example, literature, art,
philosophy, and history. In this paper, we applied unsupervised topic
modeling to the Bulletin of Opposition, the journal of Soviet opposition
published by Trotskyists in Paris from 1929 to 1941, to analyze
the main trends in the Russian opposition-leaning media. We identified
topic classes using models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation and examined
Dynamic Topic Models as a tool to single out the main issues
of interest for historical research. Applying topic modeling and statistical
methods, we proposed an approach to Retrospective Event Detection
that was evaluated on a human-annotated set of historical news items.
The present study may help to improve event detection on smaller text
corpora.
